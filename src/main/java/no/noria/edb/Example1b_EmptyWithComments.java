/**
 * The smallest working program. It does nothing.
 * Main is what is called a "method" or "function",
 * a reusable piece of code that can take inputs and return outputs.
 * Execution starts between the curly braces.
 * "void" means that this one returns no output, "main" is the name of this specific method,
 * the empty parentheses mean that there is no input, and the curly braces delimit the code to execute.
